# reel.json: the whole edit in one file

`build.mjs` turns this into `index.html` (HyperFrames). Every time is an
ORIGINAL-recording second, as printed by `transcribe.py`, except `"end"`
(the last frame) and `"outro+N"` (N seconds into the frozen outro). A time
that falls in cut material fails the build with the beat's name. `"hold:1+0.7"` is 0.7 s into the
hold after take 1. Any on-screen text with Cyrillic switches the card font from Geist to Inter.

## Beats

All beats take `at`, `to` (optional; default 2.5 s, meme 1.8 s) and `sfx`
(optional): omit for the default, a kit id or list of ids to override,
`"none"` for silence. Card beats live in the band under the chin; `emoji`,
`logo` and `meme` share the reaction slot next to the head (one at a time,
the build warns on a double booking).

| type | fields | default sound | use when the speaker says |
|---|---|---|---|
| `big` | `text`, `sub`, `count` (count up a number) | whoosh-cine + impact (text slam) | a number, a duration, a claim they would put on a website |
| `chips` | `items: [{text \| icon \| src, label, bg, fg, invert, at}]` | pop per chip (round-robin) | a list of names or numbers, one chip per spoken word |
| `strike` | `text`, `strikeAt` | whoosh | "not X", a myth, a claim they dismiss |
| `quote` | `header`, `lines: [{text, at, big}]` | impact on the `big` line | what someone told them |
| `list` | `lines: [{text, at}]`, `stamp`, `stampAt`, `stampSfx` | pop per line, impact + buzzer on the stamp | a list they then dismiss |
| `emoji` | `emoji`, `x`, `y` | pop | a feeling (push in on the speaker at the same time) |
| `logo` | `icon` (simple-icons slug) or `src`, `bg`, `invert` | pop | a product or company that should land alone |
| `meme` | `id` (library), `audio` (false = mute the clip's own sound), `in` (start later in the clip), `w`, `x`, `y`, `tilt`, `db` | clip: its own audio; image: its `sfx` or vine-boom | a punchline, a reaction, a wait. ON or just after the punchline word, never before |
| `endcard` | `title`, `line`, `url` (usually `at: "outro+0"`) | whoosh | the close |
| `nametag` | `name`, `title`, `subtitle`, `x`, `y`, `nameSize`, `titleSize`, `color`, `wipe`, `wipeDur` | whoosh (`sound.nametag: false` to silence) | a name + title card in the first few seconds (Alif). `spec.nametagStyle: "byline"` (Broadsheet) swaps it for a newspaper byline - "BY NAME" in spaced caps, an italic outlet/beat line, a brand-colour rule - same fields |
| `icon` | `name` (a Lucide icon slug, lucide.dev, fetched at build time), `x`, `y`, `ink` | ding-1 | a named concept the speaker made concrete ("working towards" -> `signpost`) |
| `slam` | `text`, `pre`, `post`, `size` (auto-fits the width) | burn-whoosh-fast | a type-only pattern break: the footage dims and blurs, one huge serif word (`text`) lands on the charged word as it is spoken, with an optional small line above (`pre`) or below (`post`). Captions hide during it. Once per video (Editorial Collage / R1b) |

`icon` (the `logo` beat) slugs come from simpleicons.org (fetched at build time, CC0). The `icon` **beat type** above fetches from lucide-static instead.

## Style, platform, look (top level)

- `style`: a preset from `styles/` (see `references/styles.md`); reel.json overrides it.
- `platform`: `instagram` (default), `tiktok`, `shorts` or `all`. It sets the safe area captions and cards stay inside.
- `sfxProfile`: `restrained` (structural hits only), `standard`, `rich` (adds a whoosh to every snap).
- `look`: `{grade: "<css filter>", grain: 0.07, vignette: 0.45}`, the film look over the speaker plate.
- `matte: true`: cut the speaker out once (`hyperframes remove-background`, cached as `assets/talk-matte.webm`, ~4 fps) for `behind` beats.
- `captions.phrases: {"a call for reach": "Coffer Reach"}` fixes multi-word whisper errors. Map a phrase to `""` to drop noise whisper heard as words (e.g. grunts during a montage).
- `captions.upper: true`: uppercase captions. `captions.keywordStyle: "serif"`: highlight words become a glowing serif italic (cinematic).
- `face`: the path to the face track, default `build/face.json` (run `scripts/face_track.py`). Without it, captions sit at a fixed height and the build warns.
- `cadence: {every, minGap, scales, emphasisScale, sfx, sfxEvery, sfxDb}`: automatic punch-in rhythm (The Closer, The Headline, The Keynote) - snaps land on take joins, emphasis words (`captions.highlight` or a trailing `!`) and a fixed cadence, alternating between `scales`, with a sound every `sfxEvery`-th one. Feeds the same `edit_truth.json` `snaps` as hand-authored ones.
- `openPush: {z, dur}`: a slow push-in over the opening `dur` seconds, skipped if a hand-authored push already starts that early.
- `captions.smartBreaks: true` turns ON smart caption breaking (don't strand a weak trailing word, fold one-word orphans into a neighbour, merge a phrase on screen under `captions.minRead` seconds with the next one). **Opt-in, off by default** (decision 6): it changes where every caption breaks, so switching it on for an existing style invalidates the measured caption rate and words-per-caption that style was tuned against in `CATALOG.md`. The five ported styles (`alif`, `closer`, `headline`, `keynote`, `monk`) set it `true` because they were authored against that behaviour. `captions.maxHold` caps how long a finished caption or editorial block stays up after its last word.
- `captions.keywords: {word: "script"|"bold"|"alarm"}` (editorial captions only): per-word treatments - `script` writes the word on in a gold hand-written serif, `bold` pops a huge accent word, `alarm` turns the word red while the frame drains to greyscale for its duration. `captions.keywordSfx: false` silences all three.
- `sound: {lines, objects, objectDb, heroDb, pen, penDb, paperIn, paperDb, zoom, zoomDb, nametag, leaks, leakSfx, leakDb}`: the sound layer gate for `paper`/`collage` scenes, the `nametag` beat, light leaks and the cadence zoom swish. Every key defaults **on**; a style opts a layer OUT (e.g. `alif.json` sets `lines: false` and reads object sounds from `OBJECT_SFX` instead).
- `packs: {"<pack>": true}`: turns on `library/packs/<pack>/<kind>/*.mp4` for light leaks, the 8mm film gate (`scenes.<kind>.gate: "8mm"` or a beat's own `gate`), film burns and `openFlash.clip`. No pack ships in this fork yet - every caller degrades to an asset-free fallback (a CSS-gradient flash) except `openFlash.clip`, which names one file and `die()`s if it is missing.
- `leaks: {every, color, at}`: a warm light-leak flash, auto-placed on take joins every `every` seconds or at explicit `at` times.
- `burns: {at, onScenes}`: a quick film-burn flash at explicit times or on every `image`/`window`/`tv` scene. Pack-only; a no-op without one.
- `openFlash: {at, dur, color, clip, media, texture, textureFilter, sfx, db}`: a hook flash on the opening frame. `sceneFlash: {kinds, which, count, dur, ...}` repeats it into/out of the first (or chosen) cutaway scene.
- `listMarks: {x, y, hold, labelSize, size, color}` (or `true` for defaults): when the speaker enumerates ("number one", "secondly", "step two"), a numbered card lands beside them - the numbered pop-up for enumerations.
- `banner: {text, from, to, y, size}`: a headline pinned to the top of the frame for the given window (or the whole reel).
- `watermark: {text, x, y, size, font, opacity}`: a faint corner mark for the whole reel. `look.tint: {color, blend, opacity}`: a colour wash over the picture. `look.exposure`/`look.contrast`: a brightness/contrast filter on the speaker plate.
- `music.drops: "auto" | [times] | {at, auto}`: mutes the music bed for ~0.5s before a payoff line (`"auto"`: the last scene, or `music.payoffAt` if set, or the first call-to-action word in the last quarter) and brings it back up on it. `music.payoffAt` also anchors `music.payoff !== false && music.drops`'s riser-into-silence-into-hit (`riserSfx`/`riserDb`, `hitSfx`/`hitDb`). `music.reveal: true | <seconds>` pre-renders the bed muffled (low-passed at `revealHz`, default 650 Hz) through the hook, opening to full over `revealRamp` (default 0.45 s) at the given time or an auto-detected turn ("but...", "here's exactly how...") between 2.2-9 s. (R1b)
- `extends: "<base-style>"` (style files only): deep-merges this style's own keys on top of the named base style, loaded first. `brandKit: "<id>"` (a style file or reel.json): layers `brands/<id>.json` - accent/accentDark, an optional watermark and flash tint, and an optional `person` that auto-generates a `nametag` beat (`until: "hook"`: on screen until the first `scene` beat, or 2.4 s). See `references/styles.md`'s "Style layering" section. (R1b)
- `toolLogos: {size, hold, x, y, pageX, pageY, sfx, db}` (or `true` for defaults): when the speaker names a product (ChatGPT, Claude, n8n, DeepSeek, Gemini, Zapier, Notion, HubSpot, Slack), its Simple Icons logo lands as a coloured app-icon tile - upper-right over footage, bottom-right on a page. (R1b)
- `objectPops: {x, y, w, hold, gap, labelSize}` (or `true` for defaults): between pages, when the speaker names a concrete thing (day-to-day -> calendar, money -> coins, emails -> mail, team, growth -> chart, clients -> handshake, goals -> target, launch -> rocket, win -> trophy, tasks -> checklist, phone, computer -> laptop, idea -> lightbulb, thinking -> brain, audit -> magnifier, workflow -> gears), its `library/engravings/png/<concept>.png` pops up on a small paper card with the spoken word as a label. Needs `library/engravings/`. (R1b)

New beat:

| type | fields | default sound | use for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `behind` | `text`, `at`, `to`, `size` (auto-fits the width), `y` (auto: head height), `color` | impact | the 2-4 biggest words, BEHIND the speaker (needs `matte`) |

## Motion layer (scripts/lib/motion.mjs)

Top-level fields:

- `brand`: `{accent, accentDark, ink, capSize, font}`. A 60/30/10 kit: one accent, a darker accent for text on light scenes, ink for dark text. `font: "Montserrat"` is bundled with Latin and Cyrillic.
- `zoom.base`: a constant punch-in on the speaker, for example `1.8` with `origin` at the face. `pushes[].sfx` puts a whoosh on a push-in.
- `captions.style: "editorial"`:
  - Lowercase lines of `group` words.
  - The spoken word resolves out of blur in bold white. The previous line relaxes to a light weight.
  - A block is two lines, or a tag pill plus two lines.
  - `tags: ["for Gen Z", "Gen Z"]` renders those phrases as tilted accent pills. List longer phrases first.
  - `highlight: ["fundamental"]` wipes an accent box behind the word.
  - `y` is the top of the block (default 1150).
- `music`: `{id | src, db: -20, fadeIn, fadeOut, start}`. The bed is set `db` below the -16 LUFS voice, from the track's own measured loudness. The library is `library/music/manifest.json`.

`scene` beats are full-screen graphic scenes over the continuing voice. Captions hide during a scene unless `captions: true`.

- **Transitions:** `in` is `blur` (default), `expand`, `wipe`, `glitch`, `slide` or `cut`. A style can set `scenes.default_in`, or set `sceneIn`/`sceneOut` at the top level to change the style-wide default without touching every beat (R1b). `out` takes the same set. Each out mirrors its in and runs slightly faster, and `wipe` out closes the left edge so a wipe in/out pair travels one way rather than bouncing back. `slide` (Broadsheet, R1b): a sheet of paper slapped down from the right, a little rotated, settling flat; its out keeps travelling the same way, off to the left. **Out transitions add no sound** - the whoosh on expand and wipe is played once, on the way in. A scene that ends where an expand or wipe scene starts stays underneath for 0.45 s.
- **Sound:** default sounds are listed per kind below; expand and wipe also get a whoosh.

`takes[i].transition` (I-17) is a **different** transition from the one above: it is the join FROM
the previous take, video-to-video, not a scene coming over the speaker plate. `"blur"` (0.18s
dissolve-through-blur out, 0.22s in) or `"whip"` (a fast blurred pan: out slides left, in slides
in from the right, 0.12/0.16s) replace that one hard cut; omit for the default cut. Both are
SFX-free by construction - unlike the scene `expand`/`wipe` above, nothing here plays a sound, so
a take join never depends on `library/sfx/` having a file behind the id. `takes[0].transition` is
ignored (no earlier take to join from) and a transition right after a `hold` dies at build
(nothing to dissolve from - resolve the hold first, or drop the transition).

`takes[i].transitionDur` sets how long that join lasts, in seconds, 0.1 to 1.5. It is the TOTAL
length: the out and in halves keep the kind's own proportion, so `"blur"` with `0.8` is 0.36s out
and 0.44s in. Omit it for the lengths above. Each half is still capped at half the take it plays
over. A value outside the range, or one that is not a number, dies at build. It is ignored on a
take with no `transition`.

| kind | fields | what it looks like |
|---|---|---|
| `card` | `bg`, `y`, `lines:[{text, at, size, color}]`, `pill:{text, at, size, gap}`, `cursor:{clickAt, dx, dy}` | Centred text plus a tilted accent pill; a cursor flies in and clicks it (ring, press). Sounds: pop, then click |
| `stats` | `bg:"accent"`, `badges:[{value, sub, at, label:"follow **bold part**", labelAt}]`, `centerY`, `gap` | Glass ring badges land big (whoosh). On `labelAt` they shrink into a row with the label typed beside them, and earlier rows re-centre |
| `fly3d` | `bg`, `items:[{text, sub, at, x, y, z, size}]`, `cam:{from, to}`, `focus`, `ease` | Words in 3D space; a camera dolly moves through them, and blur and grey level follow the distance to focus. Seek-safe painter. Sounds: riser, whoosh per word |
| `image` | `src`, `zoom:[1, 1.1]`, `grade`, `captions: true` | A full-bleed still with a slow push. AI B-roll comes from `scripts/broll_gen.py` |
| `clip` | `src`, `in` (start later in the clip), `zoom:[1, 1.1]`, `grade`, `fit: cover|contain`, `audio: true`, `captions: true` | A full-bleed **video** you supply: a screen recording, B-roll, a second angle. Cut straight in, no tilt and no pop - use a `meme` beat for a tilted overlay from the library. **Muted unless `audio: true`**, because B-roll normally runs under the speaker's voice. `in` seeks into the clip, so one long capture can serve several beats. |
| `ui` | `title`, `label`, `prompt:{text, at, cps}`, `lines:[{text, at}]`, `y` | Dark app/terminal window: the prompt types in (typing sound), result lines tick in with checks. Product launches |
| `device` | `src` (an image) or `lines:[{text, at, me}]`, `label`, `y` | A phone frame rises and floats; an image or a mini chat whose bubbles pop in |
| `kinetic` | `text` (`*keyword*`, `_filler_`), `bg`, `size`, `zoom`, `pullback`, `pip`, `pipX`, `pipY` | Full-screen word-by-word type aligned to the spoken words; a camera glides from word to word, then pulls back. `pip: true` shrinks the speaker into a round window |
| `sentence` | `bg`, `lines:["...", "..."]`, `hero:{text, at, size, color}`, `sub:{text, at, cross, crossAt}` | Words ink in as they are spoken (matched to the transcript), then shrink up while a big accent hero lands (impact). The `cross` word gets a drawn X |
| `window` | `src` or `self` (source seconds - the speaker's own footage), `y`, `grade`, `zoom` | none | Like `image`, but framed in a rounded vintage window on black. `self` needs no library asset |
| `paper` | `lines:[{text, style: "serif"\|"box"\|"marker", at, size, rotate}]`, `y`, `align`, `engraving` | whoosh/pop per line (`sound.lines: false` to silence) | A grid-paper cutaway for one key statement: a serif line, an accent-box keyword, a handwritten note. **With `engraving` set** (a `library/engravings/png/<key>.png` concept), the beat is auto-converted to a laid-out `collage` scene instead (`pageToCollage()`, R1b): the lines become sized/positioned text items, the engraving is placed under them, and `spec.pageMap`/`pagePaper`/`pageScreen` (set by the style, e.g. Broadsheet's `pageMap` remaps `serif`/`box`/`marker` to `deck`/`headline`/`kicker`) reshape the result - see `references/styles.md` |
| `tv` | `items:[{src \| self, dur, media}]`, `flipSfx` | tick-1 per channel flip (2+ items only) | A montage of clips/stills on a vintage CRT, for "distraction", "noise", "everyone else". `{self: 0}` (the default) needs no library asset |
| `collage` | `paper: "grid"\|"plain"\|"newsprint"`, `screen`, `bulge`, `zoom`, `items:[{type: "text"\|"image"\|"sticker"\|"glasses", style: "serif"\|"caps"\|"dark"\|"box"\|"marker"\|"italic"\|"headline"\|"kicker"\|"deck", ...}]` | pop/whoosh per item, gated on `sound.lines`/`sound.objects` | The vintage engraving-and-sticker "old school" look. Usually reached via a `paper` beat's `engraving` field, not written by hand. `image`/`glasses` items read `library/engravings/`. `newsprint` paper (R1b, Broadsheet) and the `headline`/`kicker`/`deck` text styles are for the newspaper look; `grid`/`plain` and the other text styles are the original Alif/Keynote vintage-collage look |

Ported from main's `engine/core` (BRANCH-AUDIT.md R1): `window`, `paper` and `tv`
need no library assets and are the three of the four actually exercised by
that port's own test build. `collage`'s `image`/`glasses` items and the
`paper`-with-`engraving` auto-conversion need `library/engravings/` (ported
in R1b, along with `objectPops`, above) - build-verified against a real
recording in R1b; see `references/styles.md`.

Helpers:

- `scripts/autocut.py talk.mp4 --noise -30` prints `takes` for a single clean take. It cuts pauses from the audio, because whisper's word times hide them.
- Scene times may sit up to 1.2 s inside a removed pause; they snap to the next kept moment.
- Each whisper word belongs to the one take it overlaps most, so boundary words are never duplicated.

## What the build enforces (warnings, printed after the SFX table)

- the same meme sound twice in one reel
- meme sounds < 8 s apart; > 3.5 meme sounds per minute
- > 14 whoosh/impact/meme hits per minute (a layered whoosh+impact counts once)
- a meme sound landing on speech (put it in a pause: extend the take's `b` to keep the air, or place it on the end of the punchline word)
- the reaction slot double-booked
- an em dash in on-screen text
